 /**
 * This source file is under General Public License version 3.
 * 
 * This verision uses a built-in Si5351 library
 * Most source code are meant to be understood by the compilers and the computers. 
 * Code that has to be hackable needs to be well understood and properly documented. 
 * Donald Knuth coined the term Literate Programming to indicate code that is written be 
 * easily read and understood.
 * 
 * The Raduino is a small board that includes the Arduin Nano, a TFT display and
 * an Si5351a frequency synthesizer. This board is manufactured by HF Signals Electronics Pvt Ltd
 * 
 * To learn more about Arduino you may visit www.arduino.cc. 
 * 
 * The Arduino works by starts executing the code in a function called setup() and then it 
 * repeatedly keeps calling loop() forever. All the initialization code is kept in setup()
 * and code to continuously sense the tuning knob, the function button, transmit/receive,
 * etc is all in the loop() function. If you wish to study the code top down, then scroll
 * to the bottom of this file and read your way up.
 * 
 * Below are the libraries to be included for building the Raduino 
 * The EEPROM library is used to store settings like the frequency memory, caliberation data, etc.
 *
 *  The main chip which generates upto three oscillators of various frequencies in the
 *  Raduino is the Si5351a. To learn more about Si5351a you can download the datasheet 
 *  from www.silabs.com although, strictly speaking it is not a requirment to understand this code. 
 *  Instead, you can look up the Si5351 library written by xxx, yyy. You can download and 
 *  install it from www.url.com to complile this file.
 *  The Wire.h library is used to talk to the Si5351 and we also declare an instance of 
 *  Si5351 object to control the clocks.

/**
 * The Arduino, unlike C/C++ on a regular computer with gigabytes of RAM, has very little memory.
 * We have to be very careful with variables that are declared inside the functions as they are 
 * created in a memory region called the stack. The stack has just a few bytes of space on the Arduino
 * if you declare large strings inside functions, they can easily exceed the capacity of the stack
 * and mess up your programs. 
 * We circumvent this by declaring a few global buffers as kitchen counters where we can 
 * slice and dice our strings. These strings are mostly used to control the display or handle
 * the input and output from the USB port. We must keep a count of the bytes used while reading
 * the serial port as we can easily run out of buffer space. This is done in the serial_in_count variable.
